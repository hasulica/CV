## Radu Asandei

Profoundly curious about the 'how' and the 'why', I've had a love affair with technology for the best part of my life. After years of studying principles of programming in formal education, I made the leap to the practical and joined Makers Academy. The goal now is to fully commit and simply *make* good-looking, solid, purposeful things.
## Skills

### Programming
While at Makers Academy I studied TDD in Ruby and JavaScript and focused on building MVC-based apps.

 - __Instagram Challenge__ - One of the Ruby apps I built while at Makers. The little green tick there to show 100% test coverage satisfies me greatly.

 - __Changr__ - Native iOS app built in Swift that works with Beacons.

My high-school years were dedicated to imperative programming in C++ and familiarizing myself with concepts like algorithm complexity and graph traversal. Won a few regional awards for solving complex problems.

### IT Support / Opperations

- Supported data-driven processes in a complex, time critical corporate environment at UBS.
- Managed IT infrastructure for a suite of 50 apps, including developing new tools for monitoring structure and capacity and implementing Business Continuity Processes.
