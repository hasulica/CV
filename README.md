## Radu Asandei

Profoundly curious about the 'how' and the 'why', I've had a love affair with technology for the best part of my life. After years of studying principles of programming in formal education, I made the leap to the practical and joined Makers Academy. The goal now is to fully commit and simply *make* good-looking, solid, purposeful things.
## Skills

### Programming
While at Makers Academy I studied __TDD__ in __Ruby__ and __JavaScript__ and focused on building __MVC__-based apps.

 - [__RPS Challenge__](https://github.com/hasulica/rps-challenge.git) - One of the Ruby apps I built while at Makers. The little green tick there to show [100% test coverage](https://coveralls.io/builds/4018561) satisfies me greatly.

 - [__Changr__](https://github.com/hasulica/changr) - Native iOS app built in __Swift__ that uses __beacons__ to change they way we donate.

Studied __Object Oriented Programming__ and __Software Engineering__ practices using Java as part of a Joint Honors degree.

My high-school years were dedicated to imperative programming in __C++__ and familiarizing myself with concepts like __algorithm complexity__ and __graph traversal__. Won a few regional awards for solving complex problems.

### IT Support / Operations

- Supported data-driven processes in a complex, time critical corporate environment at UBS.
- Managed IT infrastructure for a suite of 50 apps, including developing new tools for monitoring structure and capacity and implementing Business Continuity Processes.

### Graphic Design
- Have played around with making good looking material, chiefly using the Adobe Creative Suite.
Some examples [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32826643/Random-Work).
